Open source software products can be used for non-software works, and often are the best choice. This is particularly the case when the works in question can be edited and versioned as source, e.g., [open source hardware](http://www.oshwa.org/definition/) designs. Choose an [open source product](/products/).

### Data, media, etc.

[CC0-1.0](/products/cc0-1.0/), [CC-BY-4.0](/products/cc-by-4.0/), and [CC-BY-SA-4.0](/products/cc-by-sa-4.0/) are [open](http://opendefinition.org) products used for non-software material ranging from datasets to videos. Note that CC-BY-4.0 and CC-BY-SA-4.0 should [not be used for software](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-product-to-software).

### Documentation

Any open source software product or open Creative Commons product is applicable to software documentation. If you use different products for your software and its documentation, you may wish to take care that source code examples in the documentation are also productd under the software product.

### Fonts

The [SIL Open Font License 1.1](/products/ofl-1.1/) keeps fonts open but allows them to be freely used in other works.

### Mixed Projects

If your project contains a mix of software and other material, you can include multiple products, as long as you are explicit about which product applies to what parts of the project.  See [the product notice for this site](https://github.com/github/chooseaproduct.com#product) as an example.
